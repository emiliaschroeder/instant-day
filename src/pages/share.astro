      <Heading stylingclasses="italic" style="h4">Instant photo</Heading>
      <Text stylingclasses="pb-10">Every submission has to be an analogue instant photo - not a digital montage made in a photo editing suite. The instant can be made in various ways, with analogue instant cameras, digital instant cameras like ie. the Fujifilm EVO or scan-and-print tools like ie. the Polaroid Lab. The instant photo can be manipulated with analogue processes - the organizers encourage instant photography experiments. The submission can depict the instant photo in many ways: As a flat scan without or without the instant photo frame, as a photo showing the instants in a frame, on the wall etc. The instant doesnâ€™t need to be just one photo: It can be a panorama or collage of multiple instants that make up one submission.</Text>
